QA Survey
Instructions
You are given 2 hours to complete these two questions and email the answer back.
Write a program in the language of your choice to answer each of the following questions.
Your solution is expected to be executable, meaning that it should be written in a real language (not psuedocode), and there should be no undefined functions or methods. Standard, well- known library calls are fine. Comments in the code are appreciated.
Question 1
You are working at a grocery store and you are asked to track customers' purchasing habits by scanning frequent shoppers cards. Your cash register logs all transactions to a pipe-delimited ("|") flat text file in the following format:
customer_name|product_category|item_description|cost
An example log file is:
Pedro|groceries|apple|1.42 Nitin|tobacco|cigarettes|15.00 Susie|groceries|cereal|5.50 Susie|groceries|milk|4.75 Susie|tobacco|cigarettes|15.00 Susie|fuel|gasoline|44.90 Pedro|fuel|propane|9.60
All the items have a sales tax of 9.25%.
Write a script/program (in your language of choice) that will parse the log and generate the following output:
1. A report of the total revenue from each customer
2. A report for each customer showing how much of their spending went to each category.
3. Show the sales tax component for each of the reports.
￼￼￼
With the above example log file, the script should output should look something like:
Total revenue by customer: Pedro - $11.02
Nitin - $15.00
Susie - $70.15
Purchases by Pedro: groceries - $1.42 fuel - $9.60
Purchases by Nitin: tobacco - $15.00
Purchases by Susie: groceries - $10.25 fuel - $44.90 tobacco - $15.00
Question 2
Write a function in the language of your choice that:
• Takes as its only parameter a sentence stored in a string (e.g., “This is a short sentence.”) .
• Returns a string consisting of the number of characters in each word (including punctuation), with spaces separating the numbers. (e.g., “4 2 1 5 9”).
